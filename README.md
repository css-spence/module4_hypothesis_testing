# Hypothesis testing with SAS
This is an example implementation of SAS Hypothesis Testing to demonstrate a Paired T-Test.

This test is used to determine the effects tutoring has on sample student scores based on before and after observations for the same test subjects.

Repeated measures (inputs) being studied:
- TScore_before: student scores taken before tutoring.
- TScore_after: scores of the same students taken after tutoring.
